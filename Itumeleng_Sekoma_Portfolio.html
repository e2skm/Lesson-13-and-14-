                <h3>Project 1: Kalafong Hospital </h3>
                <h4>This is a project I completed with a team of three other students in 2022 for our Information Systems deployment module.</h4>
                <p> Our objective was to build a Database System for a Public Hospital (Kalafong), which has a challenge with record keeping. 
                    The Hospital used an outdated file system where Patients files got lost regularly, along with the Information. Here is a bit of information about the hospital.
                    Kalafong Provincial Tertiary Hospital (also known as Kalafong Hospital) is a public hospital in Pretoria, Gauteng, South Africa.
                    The hospital is situated on the western outskirts of Pretoria in the Town of Atteridgeville.
                    Kalafong serves an estimated 2 million people. This was my very first project working with other students and it was a fantastic learning experience.

                <h3>Project 2: Technical Services System</h3>
                <h4>This is a project I completed with a team of colleagues in 2023 for our Work Intergrated Learning module, at ICEP.</h4>
                <p> In this project myself and a team of ICEP interns from different disciplines within the ICT Faculty worked together to develop the Technical Services System (TSS).
                    Our objective was to develop a system that will allow TUT Staff members to log a report on any issues that requires a Technician/ Artisan to resolve. 
                    Whether it is a broken aircon, blocked toilet or broken door TSS assisted TUT staff members report these incidents with ease. Previously Staff members had
                    to call the Technical Services Department to report such incidents and this was time consuming to add to the distress incidents would take years before they got resolved.
                    We proposed and developed TSS for TUT and during our evaluation the Lecturers were exicited to hear about the system. I played the role of a Business Analyst and Scrum Master.
                    I learned a lot about the Agile Scrum Methodology and gained valuable work experience.
